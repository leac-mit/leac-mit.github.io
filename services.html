            <p> Hello </p>
          </div>
          <p>Our team monitors energy usage in two main ways: smart outlets and computer vision software. We plan to fix every outlet that has something plugged in with a smart outlet. This will enable us to monitor the use of both every individual power draw in the room and the lab as a whole. This specificity will allow us to track how long different pieces of equipment and tools are in use for, allowing us to pinpoint sources of energy loss and ways to eliminate this inefficiency. However, there are some sources of power draw that are hardwired into labs, mainly lights and fume hoods. </p>
          <p>For obvious reasons, we can’t hook these up to a smart outlet. Fume hoods and lights have visible indications as to their state of operation, allowing us to use computer vision software in order to identify these states. For fume hoods, we will be monitoring the state of the door, as it is incredibly important for laboratory safety that the fume hood door stays closed at all times except when it is in operation. We will monitor it using AR tags, black and white patterns similar to QR codes, that the software can be programmed to recognize. We will attach one to the door and one to a fixed part on the fume hood. Our program will measure the distance between the two codes and use this data to determine the state of the door. We will log when it is open and closed and will program a buzzer to go off if it has been left open for too long. We will use a similar method to analyze and act on the state of the lights.
